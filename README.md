# Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using **machine learning** techniques with **NumPy** and **pandas**. The system provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and similarity metrics.

## Key Features
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to the user's past preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests movies based on similar users' interests.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Uses pandas and NumPy for data processing.
- **Similarity Metrics:** Cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, and more.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Can be extended to use deep learning models.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for visualization)
- **Dataset:** MovieLens dataset or any custom dataset

## How It Works
1. **Load and preprocess movie dataset** (titles, genres, ratings, etc.).
2. **Compute similarity scores** using cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.
3. **Generate movie recommendations** based on user preferences and ratings.
4. **Display personalized recommendations** for each user.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the script
